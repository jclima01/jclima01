### Hi, I'm Juan Cruz ðŸ‘‹

I consider myself a person passionate about learning, acquiring knowledge, and interacting with people in order to grow together. Over the years, I have been training my skills in a self-taught way and I am ready to continue developing professionally in the IT sector, thus adding value to IT teams.
During my time as a student and then a math teacher, I learned to work and learn in a team, always trying to carry out projects that benefit all the parties involved.
